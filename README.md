<h2>Description</h2>
<p>EatEase is a project that I developed to offer an intuitive order status tracking website with key features including user authentication, cart functionality, and real-time order tracking. The platform empowers users to seamlessly track their orders while providing an admin panel for managing and monitoring all customer orders. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience implementing user management, integrating real-time data updates, and enhancing my full-stack development skills.</p>
